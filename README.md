# Open-source Parametric Branching Valve

Parametric design of an opensource branching valve for respirators optimized for 3D printing (Rhino3D + Grasshopper)
This is still a work in progress and is currently being developped with surgeons and reanimation specialists.

## Design

- The design is built around a radial distribution system of linear interpolated curves extruded in hollow tubes.
- The design should allow 3d printing without supports.
- Research needs to be done for turbulences and fluid mechanics expertise is needed.

## Parameters

- Entry inner/outer diameter
- Exit inner/outer diameter
- Number of branches
- Radial separation of branches
- Various heights
